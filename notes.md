# GoDot

## Creating a project
Click new project. I really didnt know what you were expecting.

## Adding stuff
To add assets and images, add them to a folder and put them in the same folder as that of your GoDot project, so they can communicate.

## Selecting a mode
At the top of the screen use the 2D and 3D buttons to change the scene to the appropriate view.

## Adding stuff, in the engine
To add a new sprite, simply create a new node by going to the plus button on the left side under scene. Then add the appropriate node, for a 2D body add a kinematic 2D body. To add collision add a collision body. To add a sprit, drag and drop it from your assets, then use the snap tool and select tool to mould it to your liking.

## Adding scripts
To add a new script, select the node you want to script to and press the new script button located at the edge of the scene tab.
